/**
 * Require this process to be the primary Cherry Studio instance.
 *
 * Claims Electron's single-instance lock via `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()`.
 * If another Cherry Studio process already holds the lock, this function
 * logs the outcome, calls `application.quit()` to let the shared quit
 * machinery run, and then calls `process.exit(0)` as a belt-and-suspenders
 * terminator in case the Electron `quit` path is slow or blocked. Callers
 * can therefore treat a normal return from this function as a guarantee
 * that we are the live process.
 *
 * Timing contract:
 *   - Must run as the very first preboot step, before
 *     `resolveUserDataLocation()`. That ordering prevents a second
 *     instance from entering `executePendingRelocation()` and issuing
 *     an expensive `fs.cpSync` against the userData directory tree,
 *     and removes the race window where two processes could both try
 *     to execute a pending `temp.user_data_relocation` at the same time.
 *   - Must run before `application.initPathRegistry()` so second
 *     instances exit before wasting work on a frozen path snapshot.
 *   - Does not depend on any lifecycle-managed service: `application.quit()`
 *     is the container's own top-level method, identical in spirit to
 *     how v2MigrationGate uses it on its fatal branches.
 *
 * See core/preboot/README.md for the preboot membership criteria.
